<h1>Young Tableaux</h1>
<p>Young diagram visually represents a partition of a positive integer, with a weakly decreasing number of boxes in each row. The total number of boxes is said to be the size of the Young diagram.
    &lambda;= (&lambda;1, &lambda;2, . . . , &lambda;m). <br>
    A Young tableau follow the following rules-

    <ol>
      <li>weakly increasing across each row</li>
      <li>strictly increasing down each column</li>
      
    </ol> 
    
    A standard tableau is a tableau in which the entries are the
    numbers from 1 to n (size of Young Tableaux).

    <b >row-insertion</b> or <b>row bumping</b>:- Given a tableau T and a positive integer  x, we can construct a new tableau, denoted by T &larr; x , which has one more box than  T.<br>
    insertion rules- <br>
    1. If x is at least as large as all the entries in the first row of T, add x to the end of the first row.<br>
    2. Otherwise, find the left-most entry in the first row that is strictly larger than x, place x in that box, and "bump" the entry.<br>
    3. Repeat this process with the bumped entry in the next row.<br>
    4. Continue until the bumped entry can be placed at the end of a row or forms a new row if bumped out of the bottom.

 </p>
 <p>
<b>Sliding  </b>: Given a skew tableau S and an inside corner (an empty box), perform the following steps:<br>

1. Slide the smaller of its two neighboring entries (to the right or below) into the empty box. If the two neighbors are equal, choose the one below.<br>
2. Continue sliding entries in this manner until the empty box becomes an outside corner, at which point it is removed from the tableau.<br>
3. You can then select a new inside corner in the resulting tableau and repeat the process until no inside corners remain.<br>
The final tableau obtained through this procedure is called a rectification of S.<br>
We can use anyone (Row-insertion and Sliding) to form product of two tableau. The number of boxes in the product will be the sum of the number of boxes in each.
</p>

<p>
    For a tableau or skew tableau T, we define  word of T, denoted as w(T), by reading the entries of T from left to right and bottom to top.
    <br>
    A tableau T can be recovered from its word: simply break the word wherever one entry is strictly greater than the next, and the pieces are the rows of T, read from bottom to top. For example,
the word 5644623551223 breaks into 5 6|4 4 6|2 3 5 5|1 2 2 3
<br>
<br>
<b>Row-insertion in word :</b>
Suppose an element x is row-inserted
into a row In word language, the Schensted algorithm says to factor the
word of the row into u&bull;x'&bull;v, where u and v are words, x' is a letter, and
each letter in u is no larger than x, and x' is strictly larger than x. The
letter x' is to be replaced by x, so the row with word u&bull;x'&bull;v becomes &bull;x&bull;v,
and x' is bumped to the next row. The resulting tableau has word x'&bull;u&bull;x&bull;v.
So in the word code, the basic algorithm is
<br>
<p style="text-align: center;">(u&bull;x'&bull;v)&bull;x &rarr; x'u&bull;x&bull;v  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   if u < x < x' < v.
</p>
<br>
Here u and v are weakly increasing, and an inequality such as u < v means
that every letter in u is smaller than or equal to every letter in v. In this code,
the row-insertion of 2 in the tableau with word 5644623551223 can
be written.
<p style="text-align: center;">(5 6) (4 4 6) (2 3 5 5) (1 2 2 3)&bull;2 <br>&rarr;  (5 6) (4 4 6) (2 3 5 5)&bull;3&bull;(l 2 2 2) <br>&rarr; (5 6) (4 4 6)&bull;5&bull;(2 3 3 5) (1 2 2 2)<br>
    &rarr; (5 6)&bull;6&bull;(4 4 5) (2 3 3 5) (1 2 2 2)<br> 
    &rarr; (5 6 6) (4 4 5) (2 3 3 5) (12 2 2).</p>
    We call two words <b>Knuth equivalent</b> if they can be changed into
each other by a sequence of elementary Knuth transformations,
    <p style="text-align: center;">   yzx &rarr; yxz &emsp; (x &lt; y &le; z) &emsp;&emsp; (K')<br>
    xzy &rarr; zxy &emsp; (x &le; y &lt; z) &emsp;&emsp; (K")</p>
    If T&bull;U is the product of two tableaux T and U, constructed by
    row-inserting the word of U into T, then
    w(T&bull;U) = w(T)&bull;w(U). <br>
    If one skew tableau can be obtained from another by a sequence of slides, then their words are Knuth equivalent.<br>
    Every word is Knuth equivalent to the word of a unique tableau.<br>
    The rectification of a skew tableau S is the unique tableau whose word is Knuth equivalent to the word of S. If S and S' are skew tableaux,then Rect(S) = Rect(S') if and only if w(S) &equiv; w(S').<br>
    The three constructions of the product of two tableaux agree.<br>
    <b>Row word </b> RW: list the entries from left to right in each row, starting in the bottom row and moving to the top row.
    <b>Column word </b> CW: list the entries from bottom to top in each column, starting in the left column and moving to the right.
    <br>
    <br>
    Suppose a skew tableau T is divided into two skew tableaux T and T" by a horizontal or vertical line. Then W<small>row </small>(T) = W<small>row </small>(T'
)&bull;W<small>row</small>(T").<br><br>
If T is any skew tableau, then W<small>col </small>(T) is K'-equivalent to W<small>row </small>(T).

    <h3>Schur Polynomials</h3>
    <p>
        Schur polynomials <em>S<sub>λ</sub>(x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, x<sub>n</sub>)</em> are a family of symmetric polynomials indexed by partitions <em>λ</em>.
        They can be defined using Young tableaux: for a given partition <em>λ</em>, the Schur polynomial can be expressed as a sum over all standard Young tableaux of shape <em>λ</em>.
        Specifically, if <em>T</em> is a standard Young tableau of shape <em>λ</em>, the contribution of <em>T</em> to <em>S<sub>λ</sub></em> is given by the product of the variables corresponding to the entries of <em>T</em>.
    </p>

    

    
    <p>
        The Schur polynomial <em>S<sub>λ</sub></em> can be computed using the following formula:
    </p>
    <pre>
S<sub>λ</sub>(x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, x<sub>n</sub>) = ∑<sub>T</sub> ∏<sub>i=1</sub><sup>n</sup> x<sub>i</sub><sup>entry in T</sup>
    </pre>
    <p>
        where the sum is taken over all standard Young tableaux <em>T</em> of shape <em>λ</em>.
        This relationship shows how Schur polynomials capture combinatorial information about the tableaux corresponding to a given partition.
